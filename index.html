					<h2>So what is Version Control?</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>Before that, let's see what most of us(including me) were doing before version control</h2>

					<h3>Adhoc Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>How many of you have already done this?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
                        <code>
                            ClassProject2016_final.doc
                            ClassProject2016_final_test.doc
                            ClassProject2016_final_jane_copy.doc
                            ClassProject2016_final_john_copy.doc
                            ClassProject2016_FINAL.doc
                            ClassProject2016_FINAL_FINAL.doc
                        </code>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This is already a form of Version Control!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes we use dates to differentiate files</li>
							<li>Others use descriptions like "FINAL", "preview", "john_copy"</li>
							<li>Some organized people use folders to sort the files</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>But is it enough?</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Sometimes it's good enough</p>
						<p>But problems quickly arise when a number of factors arise</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>What if you are working on a team? How will you collate your work?</li>
							<li>What if you are working on a lot of files?</li>
							<li>What if you want to save versions frequently?</li>
							<li>What if you messed up and want to get back to the last correct copy?</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Version Control Concepts</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>Repository</h3>
					<section>
						<p>The repository is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server.</p>
					</section>

					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Versions / Revisions</h3>
					<section>
						<p>To commit (check in, ci or, more rarely, install, submit or record) is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.</p>

					<h2>Types of Version Control</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h3>Centralized Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will “commit” their changes to this central copy.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Picture
					</section>
					<section>
						Example
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
                    <h3>Distributed Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						Definition
						<p>These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or “clone”) has all of the metadata of the original</p>

					<h3>Git</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>History</h4>	
						<p>In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>
						<p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked.</p>
						<p>This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.</p>
						<p>This gave birth to Git</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Goal</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Speed</li>
							<li>Simple design</li>
							<li>Strong support for non-linear development</li>
							<li>Fully distributed</li>
							<li>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently(speend and data size)</li>
