					<h2>So what is Version Control?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Before that, let's see what most of us(including me) were doing before version control</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Adhoc Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>How many of you have already done this?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
                        <code>
                            ClassProject_final_v1.1.doc
                            ClassProject_last_version_2.doc
                            ClassProject2016_10_25_ready_new.doc
                        </code>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This is already a form of Version Control!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes we use dates to differentiate files</li>
							<li>Others use descriptions like "FINAL", "preview", "john_copy"</li>
							<li>Some organized people use folders to sort the files</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>But is it enough?</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Sometimes it's good enough</p>
						<p>But problems quickly arise when a number of factors arise</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>What if you are working on a team? How will you collate your work?</li>
							<li>What if you are working on a lot of files?</li>
							<li>What if you messed up and want to get back to the last correct copy?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Is there a better to do handle files?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The answer is YES!</h3>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Enter Version Control</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>So What is Version Control?</h3>
					<section></section>
					<section>
						<quote>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</quote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>How some professions use it</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Developers use it to store source files</li>
							<li>Some designers use it to store images and/or templates</li>
							<li>Some writers use to store revisions and research files on their work</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Things you can do with version control</h3>
					<section></section>
					<section>
						<h4>Backup and Restore</h4>
						<p>Files are saved as they are edited, and you can jump to any moment in time. Need that file as it was on Feb 23, 2007? No problem.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Synchronization</h4>
						<p>Lets people share files and stay up-to-date with the latest version.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Short-term undo</h4>
						<p>Monkeying with a file and messed it up? (That’s just like you, isn’t it?). Throw away your changes and go back to the “last known good” version in the database.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Long-term undo</h4>
						<p>Sometimes we mess up bad. Suppose you made a change a year ago, and it had a bug. Jump back to the old version, and see what change was made that day.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Track Changes</h4>
						<p>As files are updated, you can leave messages explaining why the change happened (stored in the VCS, not the file). This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over time, and why.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Track Ownership</h4>
						<p>A VCS tags every change with the name of the person who made it. Helpful for blamestorming giving credit.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Sandboxing, or insurance against yourself</h4>
						<p>Making a big change? You can make temporary changes in an isolated area, test and work out the kinks before “checking in” your changes.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Branching and merging</h4>
						<p>A larger sandbox. You can branch a copy of your code into a separate area and modify it in isolation (tracking changes separately). Later, you can merge your work back into the common area.</p>
					</section>

					<h2>Version Control Concepts</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Repository, Working Copy and Versions</h3>
					<section>
						Version control uses a <u>repository</u> (a database of changes) and a <u>working copy</u> where you do your work.
					</section>
					<section>
						A <em>repository</em> is a database of all the edits to, and/or historical versions (snapshots) of, your project.
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Your <em>working copy</em> (sometimes called a checkout) is your personal copy of all the files in the project.</p>
						<p>You make arbitrary edits to this copy, without affecting your teammates.</p>
						<p>When you are happy with your edits, you <em>commit</em> your changes to a <em>repository</em>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/repository.png" alt="Repository and Working Copy">
					</section>
					<section>
						When you do a <u>commit</u>(or a checkin), you get a new <u>version</u>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/basic_checkin.png" alt="Basic Checkin">
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Revert</h3>
					<section>
						If you don’t like your changes and want to start over, you can revert to the previous version and start again (or stop).
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/checkout_edit.png" alt="Checkout Edit">
					</section>
					<section>
						NOTE: You are <strong>not</strong> limited to reverting to the last version. You can actually go back to any version you want!
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Branching</h3>
					<section>
						<p>There are some cases when you want to experiment or commit changes to the repo that could break things elsewhere in your code (like working on a new feature).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Instead of committing this code directly to the main set of files (usually referred to as trunk or master), you can create something called a <u>branch</u>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A branch allows you to create a copy (or snapshot) of the repository that you can modify in parallel without altering the main set. You can continue to commit new changes to the branch as you work, while others commit to the trunk or master without the changes affecting each other.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/branching.png" alt="Branching">
					</section>
					<section>
						You can have lots of branches per repository. In fact, when using the right conventions, it is encouraged.
					</section>

					<h2>Types of Version Control</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h3>Centralized Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will “commit” their changes to this central copy.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/centralized_version_control.png" alt="Centralized Version Control">
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
                    <h3>Distributed Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files.</p>
						<p>Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive.</p>
						<p>This copy (or “clone”) has all of the metadata of the original</p>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Different Version Control Implementations</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>SVN</h3>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/subversion.png" alt="Subversion">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>SVN was created as an alternative to CVS that would fix some bugs in the CVS system while maintaining high compatibility with it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Features</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Includes atomic operations</li>
							<li>Cheaper branch operations</li>
							<li>Wide variety of plug-ins for IDEs</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Git</h3>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/git.png" alt="Git">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The original concepts for Git were to make a faster, distributed revision control system that would openly defy conventions and practices used in CVS. It is primarily developed for Linux and has the highest speeds on there.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Features</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Distributed</li>
							<li>Dramatic increase in operation speed</li>
							<li>Cheap branch operations</li>
							<li>Full history tree available offline</li>
							<li>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently(speend and data size)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Mercurial</h3>
					<section>
						<img src="/images/mercurial.png" alt="Mercurial">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It was originally made to compete with Git for Linux kernel development, and as Git was selected, Mercurial has seen less success in that area.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Mercurial shares some features with SVN as well as being a distributed system, and because of the similarities, the learning curve for those already familiar with SVN will be less steep.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Features</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Distributed</li>
							<li>Easier to learn than Git</li>
							<li>Better documentation</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
					<section>
						<p>Just think of Version Control as "Time Machine" for your files</p>
						<p>You can go back and forth between time and even create multiple timelines!</p>
