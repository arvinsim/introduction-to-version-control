					<h2>So what is Version Control?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Before that, let's see what most of us(including me) were doing before version control</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Adhoc Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>How many of you have already done this?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
                        <code>
                            ClassProject2016_final.doc
                            ClassProject2016_final_test.doc
                            ClassProject2016_final_jane_copy.doc
                            ClassProject2016_final_john_copy.doc
                            ClassProject2016_FINAL.doc
                            ClassProject2016_FINAL_FINAL.doc
                        </code>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This is already a form of Version Control!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes we use dates to differentiate files</li>
							<li>Others use descriptions like "FINAL", "preview", "john_copy"</li>
							<li>Some organized people use folders to sort the files</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>But is it enough?</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Sometimes it's good enough</p>
						<p>But problems quickly arise when a number of factors arise</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>What if you are working on a team? How will you collate your work?</li>
							<li>What if you are working on a lot of files?</li>
							<li>What if you want to save versions frequently?</li>
							<li>What if you messed up and want to get back to the last correct copy?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Is there a better to do handle files?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The answer is YES!</h3>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Enter version control</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>So What is Version Control?</h3>
					<section></section>
					<section>
						<quote>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</quote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>How some professions use it</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Developers use it to store source files</li>
							<li>Some designers use it to store images and/or templates</li>
							<li>Some writers use to store revisions and research files on their work</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Things you can do with version control</h3>
					<section></section>
					<section>
						<h4>Backup and Restore</h4>
						<p>Files are saved as they are edited, and you can jump to any moment in time. Need that file as it was on Feb 23, 2007? No problem.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Synchronization</h4>
						<p>Lets people share files and stay up-to-date with the latest version.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Short-term undo</h4>
						<p>Monkeying with a file and messed it up? (That’s just like you, isn’t it?). Throw away your changes and go back to the “last known good” version in the database.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Long-term undo</h4>
						<p>Sometimes we mess up bad. Suppose you made a change a year ago, and it had a bug. Jump back to the old version, and see what change was made that day.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Track Changes</h4>
						<p>As files are updated, you can leave messages explaining why the change happened (stored in the VCS, not the file). This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over time, and why.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Track Ownership</h4>
						<p>A VCS tags every change with the name of the person who made it. Helpful for blamestorming giving credit.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Sandboxing, or insurance against yourself</h4>
						<p>Making a big change? You can make temporary changes in an isolated area, test and work out the kinks before “checking in” your changes.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Branching and merging</h4>
						<p>A larger sandbox. You can branch a copy of your code into a separate area and modify it in isolation (tracking changes separately). Later, you can merge your work back into the common area.</p>
					</section>

					<h2>Version Control Concepts</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Repository</h3>
					<section>
						<p>The repository is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Picture
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Versions / Revisions</h3>
					<section>
						<p>To commit (check in, ci or, more rarely, install, submit or record) is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.</p>

					<h2>Types of Version Control</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
                    <h3>Centralized Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will “commit” their changes to this central copy.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Picture
					</section>
					<section>
						Example
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
                    <h3>Distributed Version Control</h3>
					<section>
						Definition
						<p>These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or “clone”) has all of the metadata of the original</p>

					<h3>Git</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>History</h4>	
						<p>In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>
						<p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked.</p>
						<p>This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.</p>
						<p>This gave birth to Git</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Goal</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Speed</li>
							<li>Simple design</li>
							<li>Strong support for non-linear development</li>
							<li>Fully distributed</li>
							<li>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently(speend and data size)</li>
